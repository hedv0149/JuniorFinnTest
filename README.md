Xamarin Forms 



SOLUTION DESCRIPTION

I made solution in Xamarin Forms, because I am right now working on schools project (Security in the box) that also uses Xamarin Forms for all platforms with sheared Project. Because of that I felt more confident with Xamarin Forms, but I also selected only android as it is only type of platform I can test with right now.

I had no need for more than one page, so I used the premade content page MainPage. I divided the page in to 2 bigger parts – top part, where you can switch between favorite ads and all ads, and bottom part, where ads are shown.

For ads I created class to create objects from JSON data. I was asked to get picture, price, location and title. As I did not find anything that would be called Title in data, and in given picture it seemed to be more of a description then title under the pictures, I used description as title.



PROUD OF

As I don’t have much experience with mobile apps yet (I have no previous experience except these projects and one more, smaller one) I am proud of all problems I encountered and solved.

One of the problems I encountered was that for some reason I am not able to access x:Name properties in xaml.cs code. I solved it eventually, but it took me a lot of time.

Also just getting Xamarin to work was awesome! Just by creating project I had multiple errors and A LOT of warnings. Starting from problems that projects path was too long, needed to get new SDKs, ContentPage is not Page… That one is still mystery for me, I have no idea why that error was there and how I fixed it. :D

Other smaller problem that I had was to understand how to make layout look good. This is part that I am only half proud… As I did not finish it. But I do think that with bit more time and a lot more tutorials in YouTube, Stackoverflow and Xamarin forums I would have managed it.



COULD HAVE DONE BETTER

One of the big problems that I had was with JSON data. I haven’t worked with it much, just some lessons. So I did start on it, but I easily got confused as there are so many tutorials to watch and read. I spend hours of trying to get that part done, the code got messy and in the last day I just deleted everything (Ads class) to start from the scratch. And when I remade my Ads Object I realized that one of possible reasons why I was unsuccessful could be that I did not create objects in the way that data was. I skipped a lot of it even though to retrieve it I needed to create objects for all of it and then pick only the needed parts. I did not have time to check if that was one of my mistakes. But I do think that I was close or at least closer to solving my issue.

Also I am very disappointed in the way I builded the GridForPuttingDataIntoTwoColumnss. The idea is there, but I did not manage to find yet the reason for why did it take only the first Label from the list and displayed but not the second, and when there was 3 items or more the whole app just turns white, not just bottom part, but everything disappears. I made the Label list to have just something to test with as I did it before I started to work with JSON. But as it did not work I putted it aside without realizing that I won’t have time to return to it.

The biggest problem that I faced and that I am really angry about, was that I had 3 projects at the same time. It was just bad project management, my own fault. I took too much work right after the Easter and that made it hard to work on any of them, the only plus to this was that as I was having problems with Visual Studio I was having them in all projects, so by solving them I did move on with all 3 of them.



THINGS I WOULD DO IF I WOULD HAVE MORE TIME

I already mentioned that if I would have had more time I would have finished the layout. I would also probably solved the JSON problem in one or other way, maybe by asking for help to my classmates at the end. Basically to finish this project I do need more knowledge, but I can acquire it on the way if I have enough time to find answers to even most stupid mistakes.
